## Usage Examples

### Getting Facility Information
- "What time is lunch?"
- "When are activities today?"
- "Where is the library?"
- "Who is on duty right now?"

### Personal Schedule
- "What's on my schedule today?"
- "Remind me about my appointment at 2pm"
- "Do I have any appointments tomorrow?"

### Requesting Help
- "I need help from a nurse"
- "Can you call someone to help me?"
- "I'm not feeling well" (triggers staff call)
- "I fell!" (triggers emergency alert)

## Architecture

### Tools Structure
```
src/tools/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facility_tool.py    # Facility info, dining, activities, locations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schedule_tool.py    # Personal schedules and reminders
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ staff_tool.py       # Staff assistance and emergency alerts
```

### Data Files
```
src/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facility_info.json  # Facility details, schedules, staff
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ schedules.json      # Resident personal schedules
```

## Customization

### Update Facility Information
Edit `src/data/facility_info.json` to reflect your facility's:
- Dining hours and meal times
- Activity schedules
- Room locations and floor plans
- Staff names and shifts
- Services and amenities

### Update Activities Schedule
Modify the `activities.daily_schedule` section in `facility_info.json` to match your weekly programming.

### Add Resident Schedules
Edit `src/data/schedules.json` to add or update individual resident schedules.

### Customize Agent Personality
Modify the `instructions` in `src/agent.py` to adjust:
- Tone and language style
- Response patterns
- Safety protocols
- Escalation procedures

## Testing

Run the test suite using pytest:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Tests include:
- Friendly greeting and assistance offering
- Medical advice refusal (always refers to staff)
- Inappropriate request handling
- Facility information retrieval
- Emergency detection and staff calling

## Safety & Compliance

### Medical Safety
- **No Medical Advice**: Agent never provides medication recommendations or medical guidance
- **Staff Referral**: All health concerns are immediately referred to nursing staff
- **Emergency Response**: Keywords like "pain", "fall", "chest", "emergency" trigger immediate alerts

### Privacy Considerations
- Resident data is stored locally
- No PHI (Protected Health Information) should be stored in plain text
- Implement encryption for production deployment
- Comply with HIPAA regulations for healthcare data

### Emergency Protocols
The agent detects emergency keywords and:
1. Logs critical alert
2. Notifies staff immediately (would integrate with nurse call system)
3. Provides reassuring response to resident
4. Documents incident timestamp

## Integration Opportunities

### Current State (MVP)
- Static facility data from JSON files
- Basic staff notification logging
- Pre-defined schedules

### Future Production Integrations
- **EHR/EMR Systems**: Real-time appointment data
- **Nurse Call Systems**: Direct integration with facility alert systems
- **Building Management**: Smart room controls, lighting, temperature
- **Calendar Systems**: Sync with facility-wide event calendars
- **Family Portal**: Share updates with family members
- **Wearables**: Integration with health monitoring devices

## Deployment

### Development
```bash
uv run python src/agent.py dev
```

### Production
```bash
uv run python src/agent.py start
```

See the [deployment guide](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/ops/deployment/) for production deployment to LiveKit Cloud or self-hosted environments.
